My name is Noriko Tamari. I am a PhD student at the University of Arizona. I have a research focus on understanding human behaviors and Plasmodium infection to improve disease control. In my master project, I revealed the impact of the number of people sharing a bed net on the transmission. Currently, I work to identify the risk factors in outside latrines.
